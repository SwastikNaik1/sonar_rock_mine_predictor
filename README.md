# sonar_rock_mine_predictor
This project involves developing a machine learning model to distinguish between rocks and mines using sonar signals. By analyzing sonar data, the model identifies patterns and features that differentiate these two types of objects. This application holds significant potential in fields such as underwater exploration and resource extraction, where accurately identifying objects on the ocean floor is crucial. The model's performance is evaluated based on its accuracy and ability to generalize to new, unseen data, demonstrating the effectiveness of machine learning in solving real-world problems.
